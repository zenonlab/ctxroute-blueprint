# Agent Instructions

## Mandatory initialization

While `.project/project-config.json` has `"status": "template"`, before writing product code, the agent must:

1. Read every starter document and the complete user request.
2. Identify goals, constraints, and genuinely missing information.
3. Define language, runtime, frontend, backend, storage, tests, deployment, observability, security, and performance constraints in `docs/00-project-brief.md`.
4. Produce `docs/architecture/context.md`, then `docs/architecture/containers.md`.
5. Choose the test strategy in `docs/02-quality-strategy.md`.
6. Add required ADRs under `docs/decisions/`.
7. Remove guide comments and placeholders, record only real decisions and commands, then change `.project/project-config.json` to `initialized`.
8. Validate the complete structure, request confirmation before any deletion, and commit verified work automatically.

If the request already provides this information, use it directly and report only important missing decisions.

Once the project is `initialized`, follow Development, Audit, Documentation, and Git without restarting initialization.

## Communication

- Lead with the action or answer.
- Be concise.
- Put one piece of information per line.
- Avoid digressions.
- Give one next action.
- Briefly state the current status.

## Development

- Read existing files before writing.
- Read the relevant documents and diagrams before changing code.
- For structural changes, read the C4 Context, C4 Container, and relevant ADRs.
- Reuse existing functions, components, and patterns.
- Define success criteria before coding.
- Make the smallest viable change.
- Touch only necessary files.
- Avoid speculative abstractions and refactors.
- Verify every modification.
- Review the diff after each write.
- Complete one step before starting the next.

## Audit

- Audit generated code and its diff.
- Check placement, architecture, structure, and reuse.
- Check for duplication, regressions, deletions, and side effects.
- Audit `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.codex/hooks.json`, and modified hooks.
- Verify scope, consistency, format, security, and actual behavior.
- Report issues before continuing.

## Documentation

- Update documentation when architecture, contracts, flows, state, or dependencies change.
- After a code change, explicitly determine whether a document or diagram must change.
- Before adding a module, contract, or dependency, update the relevant C4 document.
- Store diagrams as versioned text.
- Use C4 for architecture levels.
- Use Mermaid for executable, readable diagrams.
- Record important decisions in `docs/decisions/`.

## Git

- One verified functional step per commit.
- Branches: `feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `test/`, `docs/`, `chore/`, `perf/`.
- Commits: `type(scope): short description`.
- Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `perf`.
- Request confirmation before deletion.
- Commit verified functional steps automatically without requesting confirmation.
- Never delete automatically.
