# ADR-0002 — CTXRoute integration

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-08-24

## Context

The template needs relevant project rules to reach coding agents at the action
where they matter. Absolute paths in hook configuration are not reusable across
clones or operating systems.

## Decision

Install CTXRoute from the official `zenonlab/ctxroute` HTTPS archive, pinned to
a reviewed commit. Keep CTXRoute configuration and rule documents in the derived
project under the canonical `.claude/hooks/docs/` path. Invoke the six supported
Codex hooks through a small project-local Node wrapper that resolves dependency
and data paths at runtime.

## Alternatives

Global installation would make project behavior depend on each contributor's
machine. Vendoring CTXRoute would duplicate its source and complicate updates.
Absolute hook paths would break when a project is cloned elsewhere.

## Consequences

Node.js 22+ is required by the pinned CTXRoute version. `npm run setup` installs
and validates the engine, Mermaid browser, and repository Git hooks. Tracked
hook configuration works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Dependency updates
require an explicit commit review and ADR update.

The reviewed CTXRoute pin is
`76b45a57543c940c51e382a41adb749faa44bbc4`. It preserves version 2.0.0 and
the six hook entry points used by the template while incorporating the current
upstream address-consistency and mutation-runner fixes.
